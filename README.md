# Sort-Num-Game-Design-Project
A game that I completed with peers for a Game Design course in college. The goal of the game is to tap all the numbers in numerical order as they fall down the screen.
You must tap the numbers before they reach the bottom of the screen, or you risk losing life. You will also lose life if you don't tap a number in correct numerical order.
The more numbers you tap correctly, the more points you will add to your score.
